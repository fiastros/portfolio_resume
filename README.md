# Portfolio Webapp Install and Launch

## Setup & installation

Be sure that you have at least python3 ( I'm running on python 3.9.2) installed on your system.
Next step is download this repository on your local computer. 
<br> On Linux/Mac open the terminal and do the command: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fiastros/portfolio_resume
```

Second step is installing all the needed python libraries to run the program. 
<br> In a terminal (Linux/Mac) type : replace with the pip you have (pip or pip3)

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Third step, you can now launch the app: 
from a terminal (Linux/Mac) type: replce "pip" with what you have on your computer (pip or pip3)
```bash
python3 main.py  ou python main.py
```

## Ongoing work and further improvements

Currently (at the time of writing ): 
- I'm making the back-end of the website 
using 100% Python. 
- Next step will be to host this website on my raspberry pi so that 
Anyone could access it online from anywhere.
